# BERT modification for longer texts

## Motivation
The BERT model can only use the text of the maximal length of $512$ tokens (roughly speaking: token = word). It is built in the model architecture and cannot be directly changed. Discussion of this issue can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/bert/issues/27).

## Method
Method to overcome this issue was proposed by Devlin (one of the authors of BERT) in the previously mentioned discussion: [comment](https://github.com/google-research/bert/issues/27#issuecomment-435265194).

The procedure of splitting and pooling is determined by the hyperparameters of the class `BertClassifierWithPooling`. These are `maximal_text_length`, `chunk_size`, `stride`, `minimal_chunk_length`,  and `pooling_strategy`.
They are used in the following way:
- The parameter `maximal_text_length` is used to truncate the tokens. It can be either `None`, which means no truncation, or an integer, determining the number of tokens to consider. Standard BERT truncates to $510$ tokens because it needs $2$ additional tokens at the beginning and the end.
- The integer parameter `chunk_size` determines the size (in number of tokens) of each chunk. This parameter cannot be larger than $510$. Otherwise, we will not be able to fit the chunk into the input of BERT.
- Tokens may overlap depending on the parameter `stride`.
- In other words: we get chunks by moving the window of the size `chunk_size` by the length equal to `stride`. Stride cannot be bigger than chunk size. Chunks must overlap or be near each other.
- Stride has the analogous meaning here to that in [convolutional neural networks](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/stride).
- The `chunk_size` is analogous to [kernel_size](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv1d.html) in 1D CNNs.
- We ignore chunks which are too small - smaller than `minimal_chunk_length`. This parameter cannot be set larger than `chunk_size`.
- See the example in [the aforementioned comment](https://github.com/google-research/bert/issues/27#issuecomment-435265194).
- More examples of splitting with different sets of parameters are in [test_splitting](../tests/model/test_splitting.py).
- The string parameter `pooling_strategy` is used at the end to aggregate the model results. It can be either `mean` or `max`.

### 1. Preparing a single text
We follow [this instruction](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2021/04/apply-transformers-any-length-text.html). The main difference is that we allow the text chunks to overlap.
- Tokenize the whole text (if `maximal_text_length=None`) or truncate to the size `maximal_text_length`.
- Split the tokens into chunks based on the model hyperparameters `chunk_size`, `stride`, and `minimal_chunk_length`.
- For each chunk add special tokens at the beginning and the end.
- Add padding tokens to make all tokenized sequences the same length.
- Stack the tensor chunks into one via `torch.stack`.

### 2. Model evaluation
- The stacked tensor is then fed into the model as a mini-batch.
- We get $N$ probabilities, one for each text chunk.
- We obtain the final probability by using the aggregation function on these probabilities (this function is mean or maximum - it depends on the hyperparameter `pooling_strategy`).

### 3. Fine-tuning the classifier
- During training, we do the same steps as above. The crucial part is that all the operations of the type `cat/stack/split/mean/max` must be done on tensors with the attached gradient. That is, we use built-in torch tensor transformations. Any intermediate conversions to lists or arrays are not allowed. Otherwise, the crucial backpropagation command `loss.backward()` won't work. More precisely, we override the standard `torch` training loop in the method `_evaluate_single_batch` in the [bert_with_pooling.py](../lib/model/bert_with_pooling.py).
- Because the number of chunks for the given input text is variable, texts after tokenization are tensors with variable length. The default torch class `Dataloader` cannot allow this (because it automatically wants to stack the tensors). That is why we create custom dataloaders with overwritten method `collate_fn` - more details can be found [here](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/dataloader-for-various-length-of-data/6418).

## Remarks
- Because we fed all the text chunks as a mini-batch, the procedure may use a lot of GPU memory to fit all the gradients during fine-tuning even with `batch_size=1`. In this case, we recommend setting the parameter `maximal_text_length` to truncate longer texts. Naturally, this is the trade-off between the context we want the model to look at and the available resources. Setting `maximal_text_length=510` is equivalent to using the standard BERT model with truncation.
